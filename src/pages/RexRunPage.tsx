            This project was a short 2D game where you play as a dinosaur trying
            to escape an island with an active volcano before it erupts. This
            was my first experience bringing a game to completion, which was an
            amazing sight to see. For this project, we focus on getting a
            complete game and making it look like a real game.

          <h1>About This Project</h1>
          <p>
            This project was a class project in my Game Design class at
            university. This class was given the task of building a 2D game from
            scratch, but you were allowed to use any premade assets you could
            find. We scoured itch.io for different characters to base our game
            on and then we found the{" "}
            <a href="https://arks.itch.io/dino-characters">Dino Character</a>{" "}
            pack, which you can see with 4 dinosaurs, each with its own set of
            animations. This was an awesome find, and we had decided to make a
            2D platformer with these characters.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the beginning of the game called Rex Run, where you play as
            a dinosaur living on a small island with an active volcano that is
            about to erupt. You race to finish quests and contracts to get
            enough money to buy a boat and escape the island before the volcano
            erupts. This is a 5-level 2D platformer where you can collect money
            and quest items to buy upgrades from NPCs, all in an effort to get
            off the island.

          <h1>Main Hub</h1>
          <p>
            This is the main hub where you can talk to all the NPCs, choose
            which level you would like to play, and at the end sail away from
            the island. There are 3 NPCs in this area, which are the chef, the
            shopkeeper, and the Dock Worker. Each of these NPCs has a quest for
            the player to complete, and once their quest is completed, the
            player unlocks the upgrades the NPC sells.

          <p>
            This is the Chef, and his quest is to find 4 mushrooms for his
            signature mushroom and chicken dish. Once you go through the levels
            and find his four mushrooms, he will then allow you to buy some of
            his dish, which will increase your health by 10 with each purchase.

            This is the Shopkeeper, and his quest is to find 5 balloons for his
            son's birthday party. Once you find all the balloons, the shopkeeper
            will let you buy two upgrades from him. The first is an upgrade for
            tougher skin, which will reduce the damage a player takes when being
            hit by half. The second upgrade is a coin multiplier that doubles
            the amount each coin is worth each time you buy it.

            game.

          <p>
            This is the first level the player can play, and it is designed to
            be nice and simple to let the player get a handle on jumping,
            avoiding obstacles, collecting coins, and collecting quest items.
            This level contains 3 of the mushrooms for the chef's quest.

          <h1>Level 2</h1>
          <p>
            This is the second level, and for this level we decided to add more
            player-injuring obstacles as well as an underground area that the
            player has to find the entrance to. We add the underground area to
            show the player that they will have to start searching the levels
            for the quest items instead of just running through the level and
            coming across them. This level contained the last mushroom for the
            chef's quest as well as the first two balloons from the shopkeeper's
            quest.

          <h1>Level 3</h1>
          <p>
            This is the third level, and for this level as you can see, there
            are more hidden areas where quest items are becoming harder and
            harder to find. This level pushes to have a lot of movement to add
            more difficulty for the player, and we did this by adding moving
            platforms as well as moving fire columns. This means the player
            would have to be really patient and careful as they move through the
            map. For another increase in difficulty, we added an instant-kill
            pit, which will kill the player if they fall. This level contains
            the last 3 balloons for the shopkeeper's quest.

          <h1>Level 4</h1>
          <p>
            This is the fourth level, and for this level we added some more
            obstacles for the player to dodge. The main difference in this level
            is that it has a secret room hiding underneath the exit. This secret
            room has coins worth 10 and a fish for the dock worker's quest. This
            level contains the first 3 fish for the dock worker's quest.

          <h1>Level 5</h1>
          <p>
            This is the last level, and for this level a bit more difficult, so
            we added another instant-kill pit under some platforms. Then we
            created a smoky part where a player has to be very observant to
            dodge the fire. We also have a big room full of hard-to-navigate
            platforms where, if you fall, you have to start over in the room and
            might land in some fire. This level contains the last 3 fish for the
            dock worker's quest
